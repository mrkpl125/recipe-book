# Dagestani khinkal

## Ingredients:
### For the Dough:
- 4 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 cup water (adjust as needed)
- 1 egg (optional, for richer dough)

### For the Meat and Broth:
- 2 pounds lamb or beef with bones (shank or ribs work well)
- 1 large onion (peeled and halved)
- 2-3 cloves garlic
- 2 bay leaves
- 1 teaspoon black peppercorns
- Salt to taste

### For the Garlic Sauce:
- 4-5 cloves garlic (minced or grated)
- 1 cup meat broth (from boiling the meat)
- 1 tablespoon vinegar or lemon juice
- Salt to taste

### Optional Garnishes:
- Sour cream
- Fresh herbs (like cilantro or parsley)

## Instructions:

### 1. Prepare the Meat and Broth:
1. Rinse the meat and place it in a large pot. Add enough water to cover the meat.
2. Add onion, garlic, bay leaves, peppercorns, and salt.
3. Bring to a boil, skimming off any foam. Reduce the heat and simmer for 1.5–2 hours, or until the meat is tender and the broth is flavorful.
4. Remove the meat from the pot and set aside. Strain the broth and keep it warm.

### 2. Make the Dough:
1. In a large bowl, mix the flour and salt.
2. Gradually add water (and egg, if using), mixing until a stiff dough forms.
3. Knead the dough on a floured surface for 8–10 minutes until smooth and elastic. Cover and let rest for 20–30 minutes.

### 3. Shape and Cook the Dough:
1. Roll out the dough to about 1/4-inch thickness on a floured surface.
2. Cut into diamond or rectangular shapes (about 2 inches long).
3. Bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Add the dough pieces in batches and cook until they float to the surface (about 3–5 minutes). Remove with a slotted spoon and keep warm.

### 4. Make the Garlic Sauce:
1. In a bowl, combine minced garlic, warm broth, vinegar or lemon juice, and salt to taste. Stir well.

### 5. Serve:
1. Arrange the cooked dough pieces on a large platter.
2. Serve with the boiled meat, broth, garlic sauce, and sour cream.
3. Garnish with fresh herbs, if desired.

Enjoy your delicious and authentic Dagestani khinkal!
